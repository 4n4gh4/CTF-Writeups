### Challenge

Can you access the admin page? Running on port 5000

### Solution

First, I tried with the website link itself:

Since the flag is on /admin, I tried that next:

Since it can be accessed only from server side, we'll have to access it as localhost.

I tried giving this input `http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin` and it showed me a list of banned keywords.

These are the different representations of localhost. So now we'll have to get creative.

When I tried `http://0x7f000001:5000/admin` which is the hex version, the flag got printed!
