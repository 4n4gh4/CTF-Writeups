## Chill Site

---

### Problem

I use this site a lot just to chill. I sure am glad that the site handles my passwords in "database" safely as well!

### Solution

I figured I have to use SQLi on the website but after testing the common payloads, I found that `or`, `true` and`--` is blacklisted. In the username field I tried giving `' || 1=1 #` and the response from the website was scary.

After testing countless payloads, I tried `' || user IS NOT NULL /*` which finally let me into the website.

- Username: You, Password (hashed): 6b5f8e745378e0fc64ce20dc041974b05bf5c1cc, 500 hours passed on this site.
- Username: test, Password (hashed): 9a23b6d49aa244b7b0db52949c0932c365ec8191, 0 hours passed on this site.
- Username: tuxtheflagmasteronlylikeslowercaseletters, Password (hashed): 64b7c90a991571c107cc663aa768514822896f49, 20 hours passed on this site.
- Username: humanA, Password (hashed): 9aa888e9ad7f219a13348362b4df4e41da33cb48, 2147483647 hours passed on this site.

Since `tuxtheflagmasteronlylikeslowercaseletters` is the only suspicious username, we'll have to try cracking his password. I also feel like the password might be all lowercase letters since the username is a clue.

To decrypt the SHA-1 hash, I used [https://hashes.com/en/decrypt/hash](https://hashes.com/en/decrypt/hash) this website. Which gave me the password: `allsgud`.

After entering the username and password correctly, I got the flag.
