### Challenge

They're optimizing SEO to show this garbage?! [https://seo-opal.vercel.app/](https://seo-opal.vercel.app/)

### Solution

Like usual, I began by visiting the webpage and exploring `/robots.txt` only to get trolled ðŸ˜­

![/robots.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4df6e121-f8eb-4ce3-ae47-2ecc245bd4ed)

Jokes aside, next, I navigated to `/sitemap.xml` which gave me some cool results.

![/sitemap.xml](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23b65f34-4eb4-4ec2-bfff-682fc4687670)

The suspicious `/goofyahhroute` was my next target and upon navigating there, the webpage told me what to do.

![/goofyahhroute](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb7ef866-e121-491a-9b2e-19cd6af3fd39)

When I selected the entire page, there was some hidden text that said, `then tell it to the url blud`

I edited the url to this `https://seo-opal.vercel.app/goofyahhroute?flag=yes` and reloaded the page to print the flag!
