## Insanity Check

---

### Challenge

You might've breezed through the easy Sanity Check, but this challenge is for true contenders! If you want to prove your sanity is as unhinged as mine, you’ll have to earn it.

How, you ask?

Back when we were building these CTF challenges, everyone would upload their carefully crafted puzzles, and I was the one reviewing them. But me being me—I rejected a ton of them, tossing them straight into the bin for all sorts of reasons. Naturally, my teammates started questioning my sanity, some even calling me insane. But if there was one thing that remained constant, it was the bin. Now, it’s your turn to dig in and you already know where to start... The same place where you proved you were sane!

I think you must be in the Discord server by now - [](https://discord.gg/BWYPxRQPSd)

### Solution

This was a very crazy challenge ngl. Even though I explored the discord server a lot, I only found a weird role `@r8F53sXv`.

The hint suggests a `bin` so wait... doesn't that look like a pastebin link?

We navigate to the link `https://pastebin.com/r8F53sXv` to get our flag.
